Parcel Management System
A real-time tracking system designed to optimize parcel delivery routes and prioritize orders efficiently using graph traversal algorithms and priority queues. This project demonstrates the use of Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest route and ensures timely deliveries by prioritizing orders based on their importance.

Features

Nearest Branch Finder: Displays the nearest branch office based on the user's location or parcel destination.
Route Optimization: Uses graph traversal algorithms and Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest and most efficient delivery routes.
Priority-Based Delivery: Implements priority queues to prioritize orders based on their importance and delivery deadlines, ensuring timely and efficient processing.
Scalability: The system can handle a large number of parcels, optimizing the routes dynamically as new data is entered.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Algorithms: Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path calculation, Graph traversal for route discovery
Data Structures: Graphs for route mapping, Priority Queues for order prioritization

How It Works
User Input: Enter the parcel details, including the destination, order priority, and any relevant customer data.
Nearest Branch Calculation: The system calculates and displays the nearest branch office based on geographical data.
Route Optimization: Dijkstra's algorithm is used to evaluate all possible routes and select the most efficient path for delivery.
Priority Management: Orders are placed into priority queues to ensure high-priority orders are processed first, reducing delays.
